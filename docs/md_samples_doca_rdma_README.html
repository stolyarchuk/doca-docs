For more information on the available RDMA operations, refer to section <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-Tasks">"Tasks"</a>.</p>
<p>Each sample is comprised of two executables, each running on a peer.</p>
<p>The samples can run on either DPU or host, as long as the chosen peers have a connection between them.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Note:</b> Prior to running the samples, ensure that the chosen devices, selected by the device name and the GID index, are set correctly and have a connection between one another. In each sample, it is the user's responsibility to copy the descriptors between the peers. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md201"></a>
General Sample Steps</h1>
<p>Most of the samples follow the following main basic steps:</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md202"></a>
Allocating Resources</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Locating and opening a device. The chosen device is one that supports the tasks relevant for the sample. If the sample requires no task, any device may be chosen.</li>
<li>Creating a local MMAP and configuring it (including setting the MMAP memory range and relevant permissions).</li>
<li>Creating a DOCA PE.</li>
<li>Creating an RDMA instance and configuring it (including setting the relevant permissions).</li>
<li>Connecting the RDMA context to the PE.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md203"></a>
Sample-Specific Configurations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Configuring the tasks relevant to the sample, if any. Including:<ul>
<li>Setting the number of tasks for each task type.</li>
<li>Setting callback functions for each task type, with the following logic:<ul>
<li><b>Successful completion callback:</b><ul>
<li>Verifying the data received from the remote, if any, is valid.</li>
<li>Printing the transferred data.</li>
<li>Freeing the task and task-specific resources (such as source/destination buffers).</li>
<li>If an error occurs in steps a. and b., update the error that was encountered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Failed completion callback:</b><ul>
<li>Update the error that was encountered.</li>
<li>Freeing the task and task-specific resources (such as source/destination buffers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decreasing the number of remaining tasks and stopping the context once it reaches 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting a state change callback function, with the following logic:<ul>
<li>Once the context moves to Starting state (can only be reached from Idle), export and connect the RDMA and, in some samples, export the local mmap or the sync event.</li>
<li>Once the context moves to Running state (can only be reached from Starting state in RDMA samples):<ul>
<li>In some samples, only print a log and wait for the peer, or synchronize events.</li>
<li>In other samples, prepare and submit a task:<ul>
<li>If needed, create an mmap from the received exported mmap descriptor, passed from the peer.</li>
<li>Request the required buffers from the buffer inventory.</li>
<li>Allocate and initiate the required task, together with setting the number of remaining tasks parameter as the task's user data.</li>
<li>Submit the task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the context moves to Stopping state, print a relevant log.</li>
<li>Once the context moves to Idle state:<ul>
<li>Print a relevant log.</li>
<li>Send update that the main loop may be stopped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting the program's resources as the context user data to be used in callbacks.</li>
<li>Creating a buffer inventory and starting it.</li>
<li>Starting the context.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Info:</b> After starting the context, the state change callback function is called by the PE which executes the relevant steps. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Info:</b> In a successful run, each section is executed in the order they are presented in section 2.b. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md204"></a>
Progressing the PE</h2>
<p>Progressing the PE until the context returns to Idle state and the main loop may be stopped, either because of a run in which all tasks have been completed, or due to a fatal error.</p>

RDMA Multi-connections Send and Receive</h1>
<p>The following samples illustrate how multiple connections can be performed to demonstrate an exchange of messages between peers.</p>
<p>Please note, using DOCA RDMA CM flow (see section <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-ConnectingUsingRDMACMConnectionFlow">"Connecting Using RDMA CM Connection Flow"</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>One sample would act as Server while the other would act as a client.</li>
<li>Multiple instances of the sample acting as client need to be independently executed to simulate each client peer to reach the amount of desired RDMA connections.</li>

RDMA Multi-conn Send</h2>
<p>This sample shows how multiple connections can be established and demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>How multiple peers (clients) can send a message to a remote single peer (server) using DOCA RDMA CM flow (see section <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-ConnectingUsingRDMACMConnectionFlow">"Connecting Using RDMA CM Connection Flow"</a>).</li>
<li>How a single peer (server) can send a message to multiple remote peers (clients) using DOCA RDMA CM flow (see section <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-ConnectingUsingRDMACMConnectionFlow">"Connecting Using RDMA CM Connection Flow"</a>).</li>
<li>How multiple remote peers can send a message to their connected peers using the DOCA RDMA exporting and connection flow (see section <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-ExportingandConnectingRDMA">"Exporting and Connecting RDMA"</a>).</li>

<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p><b>Note:</b> In DOCA RDMA CM flow multiple instances of this sample need to be independently executed to simulate each client peer to reach the amount of desired RDMA connections. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sample logic is as presented in the General Sample Steps, with attention to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The permissions for the local mmap in this sample is set to local read and write.</li>
<li>A send task is configured for this sample.</li>
<li>In this sample, the data sent is printed during the task preparation, not in the successful task completion callback.</li>
<li>The local mmap is not exported as the peer does not intend to access it.</li>
<li>No remote mmap is created as there is no intention to access the remote memory in this sample.</li>
<li>The number of connections option can be set to:<ul>
<li>The number of remote peers expected by the single peer (server sender) when using DOCA RDMA CM flow (see section <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-ConnectingUsingRDMACMConnectionFlow">"Connecting Using RDMA CM Connection Flow"</a>).</li>

RDMA Multi-conn Receive</h2>
<p>This sample shows how multiple connections can be performed and demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>How multiple remote peers (clients) can receive a message sent by one single peer (the sender server) using DOCA RDMA CM flow (see section <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/archive/2-9-0/doca+rdma/index.html#src-3113769286_id-.DOCARDMAv2.9.0LTS-ConnectingUsingRDMACMConnectionFlow">"Connecting Using RDMA CM Connection Flow"</a>).</li>
